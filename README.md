Block bootstrap consistency under weak assumptions
==================================================

This directory contains the code necessary to build my
paper, 'Block bootstrap consistency under weak assumptions.'. 
I'm putting this code on GitHub mostly so that I can use 
their issue tracking.

Documentation
-------------

The LaTeX code is pretty much undocumented, but the .pdf file of the
Paper should be useful.

Download
--------

This code should be available at <http://github.com/gcalhoun>.
