\begin{itemize}
\item The appendix now includes a definition of the probability space
containing all of the random elements, which is especially helpful in
the proof of Lemma~5.
\item The relationship between the $Z_{nj}^*$ and
$X_{nt}^* - \bar X_n$ has been explained in a bit more detail.
\item A small error in the proof of Lemma 5 has been corrected.
\item The array $\{V_{nt}\}$ as used in the proof of Theorem 7 is
different from how the notation has been used elsewhere in the
paper. I've changed it to $T_{nt}$ to reduce confusion.
\item A few other minor errors and typos have been corrected.
\end{itemize}
