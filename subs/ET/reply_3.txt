Thank you for your close reading of my paper and your helpful comments.

In your report, you mention concerns about uniformity that arise from
conditioning on the sequence of block lengths in the Stationary
Bootstrap.  To address these concerns, I have substantially rewritten
the proofs: I had originally used mixingale arguments to justify the
CLT and the FCLT and argued that the bootstrapped process was a
mixingale "conditional on" an additional information set, but that
concept is nonstandard, causing confusion, and introduces many subtle
technical issues that you alerted me to.  The revised paper uses
instead a martingale difference sequence CLT for the bootstrapped
sample mean and shows that the CLTs assumptions are justified by
deriving the necessary inequalities from NED properties of the
original process.  This change leads to a more direct and more
standard logical argument and I hope addresses these concerns.

I have made several changes to the paper to improve its clarity; the
CLT and FCLT results are now presented separately.  The paper's proofs
have also been substantially revised to streamline and simplify the
main arguments.  Specifically, asymptotic normality now comes from a
martingale difference sequence CLT, not a mixingale CLT; and I no
longer use $X_{nt}^{**}$ as an intermediate approximation for the
bootstrap process $X_{nt}^*$.  There are several other changes as
well, but those are the most significant.

Specific comments
-----------------

1. "On page 3 and 4, the notation $\to^d$: does this signify weak convergence 
or pointwise convergence?  The notation suggests pointwise convergence, yet the 
paper mentions the FCLT. In Corollary 3, does the 'convergence in distribution' 
mean pointwise, or did you mean to indicate that an FCLT holds here?"

The CLT and FCLT results have been split up in this version of the paper, which 
hopefully removes this source of confusion.  Theorem 1 establishes the CLT for 
the bootstrapped process and Theorem 2 establishes the FCLT.  The original 
version's Corollary 3 has been incorporated into Corollary~2 of the revised 
paper and the notation has been changed to clearly indicate an FCLT.  See 
Equations (2) and (3) along with Theorem 2 for more precise statements.

2. "Page 7: 'for any t₀ and k such that the index of the following summations 
are well defined,...': this read a bit odd, perhaps you need to explain better 
what is meant here."

Lemma A.1 no longer appears in the paper, but I agree that the phrasing is 
awkward and have tried to avoid it elsewhere.

3. "Lemma A.3: in the definition of $\ell_n$, $p$ seems to be  missing a 
subscript."

Thanks, fixed.

4. "The definition of the 'mixingale conditional on $\mathcal{M}_n$ is a tricky 
thing.  It is clear from the followup how it is intended to be defined; yet the 
mixingale numbers depend on $\mathcal{M}_n$ now; so that seems okay, and 
equalities such as (19) are then 'almost sure' inequalities.  The proof however 
proceeds then with Equation (22), at which point I get lost in the argument.  
You use McLeish's (1975) Theorem 1.6, which is a maximal inequality for partial 
sums, which suggests that perhaps the author intends to have a supremum inside 
the expectation—yet that does not seem to be the author's intention.  Then 
after applying the maximal inequality, an object that depends on  
$\mathcal{M}_n$ results, which is $O_p(l_n p_n)$ apparently, yet no argument is 
provided.  More detail would be welcome here."

I have changed the proofs to address this concern and the next few points.  
Rather than use a "mixingale conditional on ...", I now derive asymptotic 
normality directly from a martingale difference sequence CLT (since the blocks 
are independent under the bootstrap) and use NED of the original stochastic 
array to derive the necessary conditions on the second moments; this often 
involves explicitly rederiving known inequalities for the bootstrapped process 
to show that they hold even when conditioning on $\mathcal{M}_n$.  Lemmas 2-6 
of the latest version of the paper make these arguments explicit, and this 
version no longer includes the phrase, "mixingale conditional on...."

The same points apply to issues 5, 6, and 8-10.

7. "On page 11, bottom, the author states that 'clearly $Z_{nj}^{**}$ is an MDS 
conditional on $\mathcal{M}_n$ that has finite variance and is globally 
covariance stationary condition by Lemma 5.' (sic).  This statement I cannot 
interpret at all.  Lemma 5 does not seem to have that information.  I do not 
understand how conditional on $\mathcal{M}_n$ there can be a stationarity 
property, as block lengths are different conditional on $\mathcal{M}_{n}$.  In 
short, you may consider rewriting this area of your paper and providing 
additional detail.

This argument has been elaborated quite a bit.  Theorem 1 of the new version of 
the paper proves the CLT directly and Theorem 2 proves the FCLT using Theorem 1 
and the stochastic equicontinuity argument from de Jong and Davidson (2000).  
Note that, in the context of the FCLT, 'global covariance stationarity' is 
different from and does not necessarily imply 'stationarity,' so it accommodates 
blocks of different lengths.  Global covariance stationarity 

11. "p. 14, middle and below Equation (43): '$\{Z_{nj}(\tau, 
\mathcal{M})\}_{j}$': here $\mathcal{M}$ has lost its $n$ subscript, why?"

This was a typo.  Thank you for catching it.

12. "Page 14, Equation (41): it seems that Lemma A2 and independence is used 
here; perhaps that should be mentioned."

I have tried to make it more clear where independence between the resampled 
blocks is used, thank you for the suggestion.

13. "Page 15, above Equation 44: 'can be made arbitrarily small by choosing 
large enough $C$': this appears to me to be an ambiguous statement, as this 
concerns a random variable, so I suggest that you state the exact mathematical   
assertion here.  $C$ may depend on $\mathcal{M}_n$ here now."

Thank you for pointing this out; Lemma 3 in the new version of the paper spells 
out the uniform integrability argument and its proof explicitly.  This result 
is slightly different than the one cited.   The original version of the paper 
did not account for the effect of heterogeneous means and so the normalization 
was inadequate.

14. "p. 15, below the middle: 'which converges to zero': the object is random, 
so you need to assert a mode of convergence."

This particular line is no longer in the paper, but I have tried to be 
sensitive to this concern in general.

15. "p. 15, bottom: 'To prove (45)' and onwards: here, I do not understand 
where the $\zeta$ function is coming from.  You assert the existence of such a 
sequence of functions with the property $\zeta_n(x) = \zeta_n(x-1)$ for all 
$x$, but I do not understand why such a sequence of functions should exist.  
Then, you use  Lemma A.3 and A.4 and 'the fact that $\sum_{\tau=1}^n n^{-1} 
\zeta(x + \tau/n) \to 1$ uniformly in $x$ by assumption'. That last property I 
cannot see being assumed, and how this property plus A.3 and A.4 adds up to the 
assertion I do not know."

This argument is not used in the latest version of the paper, since the FCLT is 
proved directly from the CLT and stochastic equicontinuity (Theorem 2).  The 
new argument is (I hope) more transparent.
