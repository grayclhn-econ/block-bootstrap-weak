Thank you for your close reading of this paper.  In your report, you
express concern that this paper only shows convergence in distribution
of the bootstrapped sample average, but that generally one wants to
"prove uniform convergence in probability of the difference between
the conditional probability measure of the statistic computed from the
resampled data and hte corresponding distribution in the original
data."  I have modified the paper's theorems to prove uniform
convergence, as you suggest.

The paper's proofs have also been substatially revised to streamline
and simplify the main arguments.  Specifically, asymptotic normality
now comes from a martingale difference sequence CLT, not a mixingale
CLT; and I no longer use $X_{nt}^{**}$ as an intermediate approximation
for the bootstrap process $X_{nt}^*$.  There are several other changes
as well, but those are the most significant.

Specific comments
-----------------

1. "Page 3, condition 2 of Theorem 1, $\bar \mu_n$ is not yet defined.  (The 
definition is in Corollary 2, move it here.)"

Thanks; this has been fixed.

2. "Page 3, Condition 3 of Theorem 1: 'uniformly finite'?  What does this 
mean?"

I have changed the claim from "uniformly finite" to "uniformly bounded" and 
hope that is more clear.

3. "Pages 3/4. The discussion of the random norming case is not very clear or 
useful.  Either expand this paragraph to give the relevant extensions, or 
delete it."

I have deleted it as suggested.

4. "Page 4, Equation 2.  What is $\xi$?  Should this read $\gamma$?  Otherwise 
it is not clear what it refers to.  I do not find it anywhere in the sequel."

I have rewritten this section to avoid that notation.

5. "Page 5, line before equation (5).  How weak is very weak?  More explicit 
conditions required here."

The statement of Theorem 1 lists the precise moment conditions required.

6. "Page 6, Lemma 4, Condition 1.  The set of block lenghts is given the symbol 
$\mathcal M_n$, but this does not appear subsequently.  I suspect that it is 
supposed to appear as the conditioning variables in the expression following 
equation (6)."

I have substantially rewritten this section, so the comment no longer directly 
applies, but I have tried to be more careful in explicitly labeling 
conditioning variables.

7. "The procedure described in Lemma 4 appears to be that the assembled blocks 
are random in length but fixed in number, so that the length of the resampled 
series is either greater or less than sample size n.  This might be explained 
more clearly.  At the moment the description leavse the reader wondering what's 
different."

Thank you for the suggestion; the new version of the paper does not use this 
fixed-number-of-blocks bootstrap as an intermediate approximation, so Lemma 4 
is no longer necessary and has been removed.

8. "The statement of Lemma 4 should specify convergence in distribution."

As mentioned above, Lemma 4 has been removed.

9. Page 12, line 3.  I don't think that the symbol = surmounted by a 'd' has 
been defined at this point.  Nor for that matter is the role of the identity 
symbol $\equiv$ very clear.

In revising the paper  I have removed the use of the symbol $=^d$.
