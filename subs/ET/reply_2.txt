Thank you for your close reading of this paper and your helpful
comments.  

I have made several changes to the paper to improve its clarity; the
CLT and FCLT results are now presented separately and I have tried to
incorporate your suggestions about areas to emphasize and discuss.
The paper's proofs have also been substantially revised to streamline
and simplify the main arguments.  Specifically, asymptotic normality
now comes from a martingale difference sequence CLT, not a mixingale
CLT; and I no longer use $X_{nt}^{**}$ as an intermediate approximation
for the bootstrap process $X_{nt}^*$.  There are several other changes
as well, but those are the most significant.

Specific comments
-----------------

- "The informal 'I'll' (p. 2, 5, etc) should be substituted by the
  more formal 'I will' (or even betterâ€”third person, 'it will be
  done.')"
 
I have tried to make this correction through the paper.  Thank you.

- "Footnotes 1 and 2 are confounded (it reads as footnote 12)."

Thank you, fixed.

- "The weakest condition for the block bootstrap consistency under stationarity 
  were given by Radulovic (Stat. Prob. Letters, 1996), and are tantamount to a 
CLT. However, Radulovic does not tackle nonstationarity, nor the stationary 
bootstrap."

Thank you for the reference.  I've added a reference to it in the new version 
of the paper.

"In Theorem 1, please:"

- "define strong and uniform mixing of a nonstationary series"

Strong mixing and uniform mixing series are not required to be stationary;
I have added a brief discussion of this to the paper.

- "define the norm in Assumption 2"

I have added a definition of the norm in the sentence immediately prior to 
Theorem 1.

- "which quantity is uniformly bounded in Assumption 2"

I have clarified this issue.

- "define the notion of uniformly finite"

I've rephrased this assumption to remove the phrase 'uniformly finite'

- "the final convergence in distribution is stated too vaguely here (and in 
  other theorems); one of the two distributions (the bootstrap one) is gotten 
conditional on the data, and is therefore unconditionally a random variable.  
So, usually the way to write this is use a distance between the two      
distributions (the true one and the bootstrap) and show that this distance 
tends to zero either in probability or a.s.  Which of the two are you proving?"

The distance between the conditional distributions converges to zero in 
probability.  I have amended the results to make this convergence more clear.

- "p. 3 (bottom 3 lines): is this referring to the norm convergence in 
  Assumption 2?  Why is the variance of $X_{nt}$ not depending on $t$?"

I have removed discussion of this issue at the recommendation of another 
referee; as it was originally written, the variance should depend on $t$.  
However this issue is peripheral to the main point of the paper and is 
unnecessarily confusing, so I have removed it.

- "The discussion before Corollary 3 does not do justice to the findings there.  
There is a positive result (Corollary 3) and a negative result (inconsistency 
under too much nonstationarity).  These paragraphs need to be re-written to 
bring these out more.  Also, the conditions that control the degree of 
nonstationarity in Corollary 3 must be explained."

I have substantially rewritten this part of the paper.  Thank you for the 
suggestion.

- "There is a recent discussion by Goncalves and Politis that also revisits the 
  issue of block bootstrap consistency under some degree of nonstationarity.  
How does their discussion fit in with the paper at hand?"

Thank you, I've added a reference to their paper.

- "Just after Corollary 3, a new Section could start entitled 'An auxiliary 
  finding' or something like that."

I have streamlined the paper's presentation, so this material has been moved.

- Define $var^{**}$ before Lemma 5.

I've changed the paper's approach, so we no longer use $P^{**}$ as an 
intermediate approximation.  Hence, references to $var^{**}$ have been removed.

- I am wondering if the Tapered Block Bootstrap of Paparoditis and Politis 
  (Biometrika, 2001) can also be shown to be consistent under the same NED 
conditions.

I suspect that it could, but I am focusing the paper's attention on
"traditional" block bootstrap techniques to keep it more focused and
concise.  Thank you for the suggestion.
