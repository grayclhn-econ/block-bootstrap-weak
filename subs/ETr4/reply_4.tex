\emph{On page 10, I did not understand Equation (25)\dots}

\strut

\noindent I have rewritten this part of the proof as well as a similar
construction in the proof of Theorem 2. Lemma 6's proof had ignored
one key measurability requirement and has been entirely rewritten as
well.

In addition, I have corrected several typos and made minor changes
suggested by the other referees.
