Hi Robert,

I have made the changes requested by the referees. In addition,
referee 4's concerns led me to reexamine Lemma 6 and I found a subtle
error in its proof --- the measurability requirements of some of the
variables used in the proof were inconsistent with the martingale
difference sequence arguments I was using. So I have substantially
rewritten the proof to use a different argument.

To make the review process easier, I have also included a pdf of the
paper with the changes since the last version highlighted. Thanks
again for the opportunity to revise this paper.

\strut

\noindent Best,
